      The Purpose of this Site
    </h2>
    <p>This site is meant to help students at Loyola University Chicago in the Computer Science Program in leaving and reading reviews about courses being offered.
      By being able to understand how others felt in the class, we hope that the students will be able to make more educated choices when choosing courses.
      Through the act of leaving reviews, students can get a true understanding of a class if students in the current class feel that the description does not line up with what they do in class.
