      <h2>Class Description</h2>
      <p> We will mostly work old programming team competition problems, alone and in groups, and discuss strategies for solving such problems effectively. You do not need to be interested in the official team to find these problems and the discussions about them interesting. You do NOT need to agree to be on the team to be in the class. You are welcomed to be in the class if you just want to sharpen your problem solving and triaging skills. The competition problems are reasonable ones to work on with or without the competition. They are are quite unlike typical course homework exercises: They come from all different areas, all different levels of difficulty, and the words describing them do not directly say any algorithm needed. A significant part of each problem is to classify it. Advanced students will certainly find challenging problems to work on. Students in Comp 271 should find enough to keep them productively occupied, and get a taste of more advanced techniques from class discussions.</p>
